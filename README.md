Homework 3 of STAT436 for Spring 2024 in UWMadison

Questions of interest:

  • Which mountain range has the highest average peak height and what is the distribution of peak heights for peaks that are open versus those that are not?
  
  • What is the influence of team size, oxygen use and spatial-temporal factors on the rate of successful summit?

To answer the first question, I made a ridge plot to show the distribution of height for top-5 mountain ranges in mean height, categorized by the open status. I found that the Kangchen-junga/Simhalila has the highest mean peak height and in general, open peaks seem to have higher mean peak height than those are not open.

To answer the second question, first I made a dodged bar chart with a line plot to show that larger team size and the use of supplemental oxygen is helpful to summit success. Then
I made a scatter plot to explore the spatial-temporal pattern of success/failure for top-10 popular peaks. It is shown that more successes happened in Spring, on the peak of Everest
and Lhotse. In winter, most successes happened on Ama Dablam and most failures happen on Manaslu.
